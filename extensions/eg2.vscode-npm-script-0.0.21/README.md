## Settings

- `npm.runInTerminal` defines whether the command is run
in a terminal window or whether the output form the command is shown in the `Output` window. The default is to show the output in the terminal.
- `npm.includeDirectories` define additional directories that include a  `package.json`.
- `npm.useRootDirectory` define whether the root directory of the workspace should be ignored, the default is `false`.
- `npm.runSilent` run npm commands with the `--silent` option, the default is `false`.
- `npm.bin` custom npm bin name, the default is `npm`.

##### Example
```javascript
{
	"npm.runInTerminal": false,
	"npm.includeDirectories": [
		"subdir1/path",
		"subdir2/path"
	]
}
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The extension defines a chording keyboard shortcut for the `R` key. As a consequence an existing keybinding for `R` is not executed immediately. If this is not desired, then please bind another key for these commands, see the [customization](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings) documentation.
